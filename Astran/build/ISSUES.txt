THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ASTRAN

Know Issues:
 - Mac OS 10.9 (Mavericks) drop support to dynamic linked wxWidgets (haven't tried
 to fix this since I don't have this system to test)
 - I was not able to compile wxWidgets to run on Windows systems.  It used to work
 but it's not working with the newer versions of VC++. A workaround for this is to
 remove the wx libraries from the code and use Astran's shell. It worked without 
 issues for me.
 - I'm not verifying spacing rules between same net metals and polys. This produces 
DRC errors but they are easy to fix by hand most of the time.

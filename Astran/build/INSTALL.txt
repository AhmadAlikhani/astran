THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ASTRAN

COMPILING SOURCE CODE 


- LINUX:
1. apt-get install git
2. git clone https://code.google.com/p/gme-ufrgs/
3. sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev
4. sudo apt-get install g++
5. cd gme-ufrgs/Astran/src/
6. g++ *.cpp `wx-config --cppflags --libs` -Wno-deprecated -O3 -o ../build/bin/Astran

- MAC:
0. If you are using Mac OS X earlier than 10.9, first download:
https://code.google.com/p/gme-ufrgs/downloads/detail?name=wxLibs-MacOSX.tar.gz
 
 than copy the files to your /usr:
sudo cp -R wxLibs/* /usr/

 This is needed because Mavericks dropped support to wxWidgets which is used by Astran GUI.

1. Run in the terminal: git clone https://code.google.com/p/gme-ufrgs/
2. Load the Xcode Project in the folder Astran (if you have Mac OS 10.6.8 and Xcode 4.2, jump to step 5)
3. Run in the terminal:  wx-config --libs
   Paste the output in Project -> Build Settings -> "Other Linker Flags"
4. Run in the terminal:  wx-config --cppflags
   Paste the output in Project -> Build Settings -> "Other C++ Flags"
5. Compile Astran normally

2. Unzip
unzip Astran.zip

3. Download Gurobi Optimizer from:
http://www.gurobi.com/download/gurobi-optimizer

    You need to register first. After that, install the latest version
 supported by your SO (e.g. 5.0.2 for Mac OS X 10.6). You gonna need to
 acquire a valid license to use Gurobi, it's free for academic use:
http://www.gurobi.com/download/licenses/free-academic

   Follow the instructions to install the license, they will ask you to
 run a command to validate the license.

   PS.: The Free Trial license is limited to 2.000 variables and
 constraints, you will only be able to generate very small circutis.
 The academic license on the other hand is unlimited.

4. Run the file Astran/bin/Astran.
    MAC OS: If you are using Mac OS X 10.9 or earlier, do the step 0 of (COMPILING SOURCE CODE) before.

5. You need to setup the tool in order to use it. Open View->Preferences and set the path to gurobi_cl:
    MAC OS: It's usually in /Library/gurobi502/mac64/bin/gurobi_cl

6. Set the path to your CIF viewer too. You can use wxSightGL, it's usually inside the Astran/Tools folder for your SO. You can also download it from 
    https://code.google.com/p/gme-ufrgs/downloads/list
    
    MAC OS: Set the path to: .../wxSightGL.app/Contents/MacOS/wxSightGL

    http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?glut32

IMPORTANT TIP: Edit astran.cfg and save the configuration so you don't have to set it again when you run the tool again.
